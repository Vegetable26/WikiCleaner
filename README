Usage: WikiFormatter <input_file> <output_file> <num_threads>

<input_file> and <output_file> are rooted in a /data folder under WikiCleaner. You'll have to include
info.bliki.wiki:bliki-core:3.1.0 as an external library before compiling.

Will output the pages of the wikidump as a series of lines. Each line will first contain the last modification date of
the article as YYYY-MM-DDT(Time in seconds), where T is the actual char 'T'. It will then contain a space delimited list
of the words within the page.

The 56 GB file produces a ~12 GB output file.

The program will output the following error, but it should still be correct:
"info.bliki.extensions.scribunto.ScribuntoException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: getRawWikiContent returned null"
